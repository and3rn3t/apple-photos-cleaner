photos-cleaner: one entry point for every command (ROADMAP T1.6).

    python3 photos_cleaner.py <command> [options]      # from the repo / skill bundle
    python3 -m photos_cleaner <command> [options]      # same, as a module
    photos-cleaner <command> [options]                 # after `pipx install .`

Commands are the scripts in scripts/ (underscores or hyphens both work:
`junk-finder` = `junk_finder`). Each command's own flags, output and exit codes
are unchanged, and `python3 scripts/<command>.py` keeps working.
